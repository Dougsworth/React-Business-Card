        In my free time I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and
        listening to music. I also enjoy learning new technologies and creating
        new things. I recently got into 3d printing and I am currently working
        on a project to create a 3d printed model of a robot. It's so cool to
        see how a robot can be made. I enjoy using software like fusion 360 and
        adobe illustrator to create 3d models.
