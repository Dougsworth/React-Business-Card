        In my free time I enjoy playing the guitar, watching movies, and
        listening to music. I also enjoy learning new technologies and creating
        new things. I've really been into 3d printing for some time. I enjoy
        using software like fusion 360 and adobe illustrator to create 3d
        models. I also enjoy creating websites and applications.
